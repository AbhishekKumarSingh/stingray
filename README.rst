The contents will be:

- make a light curve from event data
- make periodograms in Leahy and rms normalization
- average periodograms
- cross spectra
- lags (time vs energy, time vs frequency)
- maximum likelihood fitting of periodograms/parametric models
- bispectra (?)
- cross correlation functions, coherence
- spectral timing functionality
- Bayesian QPO searches
- power colours
- rms spectra
