X-Ray Timing Made Easy
=======================

We are writing a general-purpose timing package for X-ray time series. 

The contents will be:
- make a light curve from event data
- make periodograms in Leahy and rms normalization
- average periodograms
- cross spectra
- time lags, energy lags, frequency lags
- maximum likelihood fitting of periodograms/parametric models
- bispectra (?)
- cross correlation functions, coherence
- spectral timing functionality
- Bayesian QPO searchesi
- power colours
- rms spectra
